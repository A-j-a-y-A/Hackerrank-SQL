Consider P1(a,b) and P2(a,b) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

CODE:
    SELECT ABS(ROUND(SUM((a - c) + (b - d)),4)) AS MANHATTAN DISTANCE
    FROM (
        SELECT 
          MIN(LAT_N) AS a,
          MIN(LONG_W) AS b,
          MAX(LAT_N) AS c,
          MAX(LONG_W) AS d
        FROM STATION
    ) AS SUB_QUERY;
