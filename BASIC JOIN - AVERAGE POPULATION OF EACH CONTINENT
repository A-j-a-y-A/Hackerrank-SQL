Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations 
(CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

CODE:
    SELECT CC.CONTINENT, FLOOR(AVG(C.POPULATION))
    FROM CITY AS C
    JOIN COUNTRY AS CC
    ON C.COUNTRYCODE = CC.CODE
    GROUP BY 1;
